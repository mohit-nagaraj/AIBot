Slack - interaction with the bot
Wit - To understand & process the request
Wolfram - To run the computational tasks using model to generate the response

**Wit.ai** is a natural language processing (NLP) platform that allows developers to build applications that can understand and interpret human language. It enables users to create conversational interfaces, chatbots, voice-activated assistants, and other applications that can interact with users in a more human-like manner. Wit.ai provides tools for entity recognition, intent detection, and the integration of machine learning to improve the understanding of natural language.

**Wolfram Alpha** is a computational knowledge engine that provides answers to queries based on a vast amount of curated data and algorithms. It can perform calculations, provide answers to factual questions, generate plots and graphs, and analyze data across various domains such as mathematics, science, engineering, geography, and more. It is often used for research, education, and analysis, providing a way to compute or derive answers from structured data rather than simply retrieving documents or web pages.

Together, these platforms provide powerful tools for developers looking to create intelligent and interactive applications.


In Wit.ai, **intents** and **entities** are two key components used to understand and interpret user input in natural language processing (NLP) applications.

### Intents:
- **Definition**: An intent represents the purpose or goal behind a user's input. It indicates what the user wants to accomplish with their request.
- **Example**: If a user says "Book a flight to New York," the intent might be "book_flight." Other examples of intents could include "get_weather," "play_music," or "set_alarm."

### Entities:
- **Definition**: Entities are the specific pieces of information found within the user input that help clarify the intent. They provide context and detail about the user's request.
- **Example**: In the statement "Book a flight to New York," the entity could be "New York," which specifies the destination. Other examples of entities might include dates, times, locations, or other relevant data that provide additional context for the intent.

### Summary:
- **Intents** capture what the user wants to do.
- **Entities** capture the details of how they want to do it or what they are referring to.

Together, intents and entities allow Wit.ai-powered applications to accurately interpret and respond to user inputs.
